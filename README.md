# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets define the visual appearance of the Internet as we know it today.

Here, I propose a unified visual standard to the Internet by injecting some additional CSS to  common websites.

These CSS changes are designed with the aim of guiding those who want some more visual space in their Internet experience. Less noise, less cognitive burden, less anxiety. Some heuristics to start:

1. Font size of 16 pt or greater
2. Serif font over Sans Serif font whenever possible
3. Computer Modern as the primary serif font
4. Helvetica as the primary sans serif font
5. Courier as the primary monospace font
6. Sepia color schemes after sunrise, Dark color schemes after sunset
7. Limit display of images (for real performance gains, don't fetch images at all)
8. Grayscale for videos, memes, and interactive visual content (jpg/png/mov/mp4)

# Example websites

These four-letter folders contain preliminary CSS standards for the following websites:

```
DUCK (duckduckgo.com)
FACE (facebook.com)
FBME (messenger.com)
GOOG (google.com)
HARV (harvard.edu)
LINK (linkedin.com)
STAC (stackoverflow.com)
YOUT (youtube.com)
```

# Future Work

I hope to release an extension, similar to Dark Reader, which injects javascript to enforce these standards. For now, copying and pasting the above CSS into the Stylus extension works fairly well :)
